A single-page web application containing an IEEE 754 Encoder (for encoding
a decimal value into its IEEE-754 single and double precision representation), and
an IEEE 754 Decoder (for reading the value of an IEEE 754 representation in regular
scientific notation).

The application works entirely in JavaScript; there is no need for a server.

You will need a modern browser, as the JavaScript code uses Uint8Array and friends.
